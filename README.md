## Video to frames conversion


### About
This repo contains a couple of scripts to convert video (.avi and .mpg)
to sequences of frames for use with AI and machine learning methods.

### Input
The input is a folder with videos to be converted.

### Output
The output is a folder structure based on a Patient > Sequence > frame pattern.
Each patient has its own folder, and the folder may contain one or multiple
folders with video sequences. A sequence is a set of image frames numbered 
from 1 to N.

### Usage
There is one simple and one more "advanced" script. Adjust the
_INPUT_DATA_PATH_ and _OUTPUT_PATH_ variables and run the script to generate
folders and image frames.

Of course, feel free to adjust the script according to your needs!
